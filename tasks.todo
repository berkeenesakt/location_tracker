Location App Implementation Tasks (iOS):

    Project Setup:
    ✔ Create a new Flutter project with provider architecture @done(25-05-16 11:28)
    ✔ Set up iOS development environment @done(25-05-16 11:28)
    ✔ Configure iOS permissions for location services @done(25-05-16 11:43)
    ✔ Set up necessary dependencies in pubspec.yaml @done(25-05-16 11:43)
    
    Core Features:
    ☐ Implement location service provider
      ☐ Set up location tracking functionality
      ☐ Handle location permission requests
      ☐ Implement background location updates
      ✔ Create location data model @done(25-05-16 12:10)
    ☐ Implement geo-fences manager
      ☐ Define at least two hardcoded locations with 50m radius
      ☐ Use geolocator.distanceBetween() to detect if user is inside a geo-fence
      ☐ Support overlapping geo-fences
      ☐ Optional: Add feature for user-defined geo-fences
    ☐ Implement time tracking service
      ☐ Calculate time spent in each geo-fence
      ☐ Track "traveling" time when outside all geo-fences
      ☐ Handle edge cases (stationary user, app minimization)
    
    UI Implementation:
    ✔ Create main app scaffold @done(25-05-16 12:10)
    ☐ Implement Main Screen
      ☐ Add "Clock In" button to start location tracking
      ☐ Add "Clock Out" button to stop tracking and save data
      ☐ Show current tracking status
    ☐ Implement Summary Screen
      ☐ Design daily summary layout
      ☐ Display time spent in each geo-fence with proper formatting (e.g., "2h 30m")
      ☐ Show "Traveling" time
      ☐ Optional: Add navigation to view past days' summaries
    ☐ Design and implement location display screen
      ☐ Show current location coordinates
      ☐ Display location updates in real-time
      ☐ Add location history list
    ☐ Implement settings screen
      ☐ Location permission toggle
      ☐ Background tracking settings
      ☐ Clear history option
    
    State Management:
    ✔ Set up provider architecture @done(25-05-16 12:04)
    ☐ Create location state provider
      ☐ Implement ValueNotifier<bool> for tracking status
      ☐ Create Provider for UI state management
    ☐ Implement time tracking state provider
      ☐ Track and update time spent in locations
      ☐ Provide real-time updates to Summary Screen
    ☐ Implement location data persistence
      ☐ Optional: Set up Hive for local storage
      ☐ Create DailySummary data model
      ☐ Save data on "Clock Out" or app pause
      ☐ Load data on app start
    ☐ Handle app lifecycle states
    
    Testing:
    ☐ Test background location updates
    ☐ Test permission handling
    ☐ Test geo-fence detection accuracy
    ☐ Test time tracking calculations
    ☐ Test app behavior when minimized
    ☐ Test day transitions for summary data
    
    Documentation:
    ☐ Add code documentation
    ☐ Create README.md with setup instructions
    ☐ Document the architecture and design decisions
    
    Final Steps:
    ☐ Perform code review
    ☐ Test on iOS device
    ☐ Optimize performance
    ✔ Clean up code (remove redundant files and dead code) @done(25-05-16 12:16)
    ☐ Prepare for submission
