    ☐ Implement geo-fences manager
      ☐ Define at least two hardcoded locations with 50m radius

      ☐ Optional: Add feature for user-defined geo-fences
    ☐ Implement time tracking service
      ☐ Calculate time spent in each geo-fence
      ☐ Track "traveling" time when outside all geo-fences

      ✔ Add "Clock Out" button to stop tracking and save data @done(25-05-16 15:03)
      ✔ Show current tracking status @done(25-05-16 15:03)
    ☐ Implement Summary Screen
      ☐ Design daily summary layout
      ☐ Display time spent in each geo-fence with proper formatting (e.g., "2h 30m")
      ☐ Show "Traveling" time
      ☐ Optional: Add navigation to view past days' summaries
    ☐ Design and implement location display screen
      ✔ Show current location coordinates @done(25-05-16 15:09)

    ☐ Handle app lifecycle states
    
    Testing:
    ☐ Test background location updates
    ☐ Test permission handling
    ☐ Test geo-fence detection accuracy
    ☐ Test time tracking calculations
    ☐ Test app behavior when minimized
    ☐ Test day transitions for summary data
    
    Documentation:
